### 3. Uploading the “NeoClock” Firmware

Due to time constraints, I have developed an advanced program for the IoT Smart Clock. It includes various types of
pages such as displaying the current time, date, weather, stock prices, and static messages. This firmware connects to
WiFi and retrieves the latest time and date using the NTP protocol, as well as weather and stock prices from my personal
API. Additionally, you have the option to add your own page to display your preferred content dynamically.

Follow the instructor’s instruction for uploading the firmware.
